Customers dropout : We don't care why they dropout but try to understand the randomness 

Need to model attrition and purchase

Every customer has a purchasing rate that varies across customer. There is no average customer purchase.

Each customer buys around his/her own mean of purchasing time 

Everyone has a dropout propensity which varies across people
